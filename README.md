#Sokid
NodeJS websockets implementation. No dependencies.

#### Purpose
Duplex JSON messaging system.

#### Requirements
##### Server
Node.js v10+
##### Client
Chrome browser v73+

Probably works with much wider range of technologies and versions, but is not tested.

#### Limitations
*Sokid* is written to showcase a very barebones WebSocket implementation. It is not meant to be fast nor optimized and it does not chase wide browser compatibility.
